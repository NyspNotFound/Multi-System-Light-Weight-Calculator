! WARNING !
This is just a project I wanted to share to get input! This isnt going to be a commerical product or anything at all!
It's a fun and easy way to get myself used to the ropes of the C language since I've never really programmed in it before.


What is it's functionality?
----------------------------------
MSLWC's basic functionality is simple. It's a lightweight and easy to use terminal calculator for modern operating systems such as Windows or MacOS.
It's been personally tested on Linux but is made for general system use.
At this point, there is not much to it, but I'm planning on adding on when I can.
Also be weary, I swear a lot in my source code.



That's about it really...
And please, be welcome to make fun of my beginner's code all you want!
